A collection of javascripts for a bit of fun with a website.

### konami.js

This is about the shortest way of triggering an action based on the konami code. It does rely on keyboard input so no good on phones unless you have a good keyboard installed.

A quick search digs up alternatives such as <https://github.com/snaptortoise/konami-js> which are a bit more verbose but have touch event support.

This version is based on an old blog post which has since disappeared <http://unwrongest.com/blog/konami-code-why-so-verbose-when-you-can-make-it-in-140-characters/>.

## Pranks

Obviously the point to this is to do something fun.
